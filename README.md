Machine setup/sync scripts
==========================

This repository holds the public part of the setup and config files I use on
my desktop machines. It cannot be used as-is, because there is a private part
to it, which includes setting user passwords, ssh private keys, etc. I do not
want to expose these files to the whole Internet, so these are not in this
repo. However, I understand that some people may want to use these scripts for
their own purposes. To this end, I tried as hard as possible to make as many
files public as possible, and I provide a directory layout of the private
repository in the `private-layout.txt` file. It should give you an idea of
what to do.
